A song about spiritual development, and a lack thereof.

---

limitless 
but never free

who decides
what is and is not me

another drunk night
out with friends

pick up the phone 
and make amends

[chorus]
man, i gotta detach
gotta detach

i got a dream
but id rather have a donut

crickets chirp
as i fill another hole up

i said i wouldnt
but i called her again

creature comformts
are a creatureâ€™s dead end

[chorus]
man i gotta detach
gotta detach

[solo]

[chorus]
man i gotta detach
mama says detach

wish i would detach
someone help me detach

help meeee....
shut it outttt...
make it go awayyyyyyyy...

fuck offffffff......
